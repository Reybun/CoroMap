# CoroMap

CoroMap is my first Android Project.
CoroMap is an interactive map about the coronavirus.
##
It displays a worldmap with circle on country. Click on a circle to get stats about the country. 
**You will need a GoogleMap APIKEY for it to work.**

You can also access a global list of stats where you can search for a specific country
